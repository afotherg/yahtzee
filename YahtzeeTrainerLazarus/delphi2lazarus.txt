copy the *.dpr and all *.pas, *.dfm to fresh directory
  *.res ??? not needed
mv YahtzeeTrainer.dpr yahtzeetrainer.lpr
open yahtzeetrainer.lpr in Lazarus IDE, creating a Lazarus GUI application
convert *.pas units from Delphi to Lazarus

In *.lfm:
remove Font properties (especially from TEdit objects)

In ScoreCards:
change TScoreCard.SetHint -> TScoreCard.SetAspectHint
change a in GS.free -> (a <= LastCategory) and (a in GS.free)

in Main:
change Bool --> Boolean  (could have used LTypes or such)

In YahtzeeStateTables
change rewrite(f, name)  -->  AssignFile(f, name); rewrite(f)
change reset(f, name)  -->  AssignFile(f, name); reset(f)
change close(f) --> CloseFile(f)

In YahtzeeEventLists:
proc MakeChoiceEList: exclude keep all dice

Problems:

TEdit.Font is not published (hence not in .lfm), hence cannot make them bold.
  Worked around by setting fsBold within the application
Don't know how to set monospaced font (in TMemo.Font to keep columns aligned)
  Worked around by using TSynMemo instead
TMemo.Lines.Strings in .lfm file does not work completely as it should.
  Works in TSynMemo
Cannot create multiple forms of the same type (Duplicate Name exception raised).
  Lazarus got updated, now works when Application is made Owner
ProgressBar not (yet) implemented in Lazarus?

Extras

Increased font size of dice values
Added HELD above dice to indicate keeping status
Added Windows menu
